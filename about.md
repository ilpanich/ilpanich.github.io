First of all, let me briefly introduce my job track: my current employment is as **Technical Leader** of the *Cloud R&D office* of ComelitGroup SpA, working both as the team coordinator and senior developer in both `Java` & `Rust` and a little bit of scripting in `Python` and `bash`.

I was previously enrolled as **Senior SW Engineer** (Web & Cloud, Embedded SW, ML) at *Kalpa SRL* after a 2 years job as **data analyst and IT consultant** in the Analytics domain at *Moviri SpA* (mainly working with Splunk).

Before all those jobs I was a **PostDoc Researcher** at *Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Biongegneria*.

Before starting to work in enterprise, I spent several years in academia since I obtained my *B. Sc. & M. Sc. degree* in **Computer Science & Engineering** and my *Ph. D. with distinction* in **Information Technology** at Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria.

At that time (2004-2015, considering my full academic journey) I worked and I was interested in `semantic data`, `data analytics`, `context-aware data management and processing`, `pervasive systems`, `data streams processing`.

Also at that time I have a good knowledge of Data mining and data analysis related techniques and solutions, also considering that time new emerging ML techniques; now I'm a little bit more focused on **Secure Coding** and with **Security & DevOps** related topics; I'm also trying a little bit to better understand how `vibe-coding` work and in which way can help a develop in is daily work life.

My academic & professional experience also made me able to use different DB types, from the classical *relational DBMS* to the *NoSQL* ones; Honestly, I don't care about which to use, I always try to use the best fit for each development I made.

In my spare time I like to study new topics and play with new technologies, that's where I met and learned about the Rust programming language and also where I'm pushing to improve my secure-coding best-practices; I do strongly that catching up with the latest trends and technologies is crucial for staying alive in our job, and that's why I always try to improve myself, sometimes stepping out of my comfort zone.

I'm not a workaholic, I like to spend my free time with my friends drinking a beer or going for some trekking, and I'm also involved in social activities as the "team manager" of one volleyball team of my parish sports club.
